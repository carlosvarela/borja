    At EmpathyBroker we are defining what Search Happiness is. For that we are running remote user tests in order to understand the way people search.

    What do we need from you? Just a few of your minutes to enter our demo and do a couple of tasks.
    What do you get from this? You can win a trip to London or to Barcelona for a weekend, depending if you are participating in the Spanish or the English version.
