<p style="text-align: justify;">Forget about conversion for a moment. Let’s focus on<strong> Search Happiness</strong> instead.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Imagine this, my friend Anna lands on your site. She is looking for a dress for a party but she is not sure what style she wants. She runs a generic query, e.g ‘Dresses’, and checks some products. Then runs another query, ‘Party dresses’ this time, checks some more products and leaves the site.<img class="wp-image-5717 size-medium alignright" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Search-Happiness-is-Conversion-more-important-than-Happiness--300x200.jpg" alt="Search-Happiness--is-Conversion-more-important-than-Happiness-" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anna did not buy anything, her visit conversion rate was 0%. She did not even add to cart. However, does this make it a failed search visit? Anna did not buy, but she found the inspiration she was looking for. She will definitely come back to the site and will be more likely to buy the next time. This is because <strong>she achieved Search happiness</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Happiness always depends on expectations. Expectations vary from one person to the next. Depending on what your goals are, you will achieve your expectations, or you won’t. The same thing happens with Search. However, in this case, we could divide goals into 2 groups:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Those that want to BUY something that’s known</li>
<li>Those that want to DISCOVER something that’s unknown (like my friend Anna)</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The user’s behaviour is different in these 2 cases. As their goals are different, what works for one might not work for the other. These are some examples of how these 2 groups would behave:</p>
<table class=" aligncenter" width="604">
<thead>
<tr>
<td width="313">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>BUYING Goal</strong></p>
</td>
<td width="291">
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>DISCOVERING Goal</strong></p>
</td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;" width="313">Uses singular rather than plural</td>
<td width="291">
<p style="text-align: center;">Uses plurals more</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="313">
<p style="text-align: center;">Uses more words</p>
</td>
<td width="291">
<p style="text-align: center;">Uses less words</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;" width="313">Uses words that match the language of the store (brands/styles)</td>
<td width="291">
<p style="text-align: center;">Uses words that are distant from store language</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="313">
<p style="text-align: center;">If what is expected to be seen is not seen on 1<sup>st</sup> page will quickly send a second query, or filter using filters</p>
</td>
<td width="291">
<p style="text-align: center;">Spends more time scrolling down and on results page, and less usage of filters</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;" width="313">Lower number of products viewed</td>
<td width="291">
<p style="text-align: center;">Higher number of products viewed, discovering different products</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="313">
<p style="text-align: center;">Adds to Cart from Result page (if available)</p>
</td>
<td width="291">
<p style="text-align: center;">Does NOT Add to Cart from result page</p>
</td>
</tr>
