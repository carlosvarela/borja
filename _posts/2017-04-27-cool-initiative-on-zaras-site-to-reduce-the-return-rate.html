    Everybody knows Zara, and we can proudly say that their Search Engine is empowered by us, EmpathyBroker. However, today I won’t be talking about Search. Today I would like to speak about a very cool initiative that Zara is testing on their website.

    Return rates are a big issue for ecommerce, especially in Retail. One of the reasons behind the high return rates is the lack of consistency in sizing from one brand to another. I love to see how companies are focusing on solving this and using very creative solutions to help us choose the best size.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Everybody knows Zara, and we can proudly say that their Search Engine is empowered by us, EmpathyBroker. However, today I won’t be talking about Search. Today I would like to speak about a very cool initiative that Zara is testing on their website.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Return rates are a big issue for ecommerce, especially in Retail. One of the reasons behind the high return rates is the lack of consistency in sizing from one brand to another. I love to see how companies are focusing on solving this and using very creative solutions to help us choose the best size.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From the solutions I have seen, one of my favourites is the one Zara is testing on their site. In some of the product pages you can find a link under Select Size that says “What’s my size?”, as shown on the image below.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5867 size-full" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/zara1.jpg" alt="zara1" width="700" height="333" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you click on it, it launches an overlay asking for your height, weight and how you want the product to fit, if tighter, perfect or looser.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-5865 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/zara-2.png" alt="zara 2" width="700" height="546" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you have added your measurements, fit preference and clicked on Find my size, it shows what size other people like you bought. For the information I added it said that 81% of people with the same measurements and fit preference bought size S, but it that was not what made me really like this feature. What did was the comment under the size, which gives me information about returns.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Size S was bought and not returned by 81% of shoppers with your approximate height, weight and fit preference.”</p>
<p> <img class="wp-image-5864 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/zara-3.png" alt="zara 3" width="700" height="553" /></p>
<p>I think it is a great initiative to help find the right size, which is many times a big barrier to shop online, as well as one of the main reason for returning a product.</p>
<p>The link is not available in all products. I have found it mainly in Jackets and Tops. I am not sure it is in products as Dresses or Trousers. If you want to try it, you can go to the product I have used for the post <a href="https://www.zara.com/uk/en/woman/tops/view-all/pearl-studded-top-with-ruffles-c719021p4590552.html">https://www.zara.com/uk/en/woman/tops/view-all/pearl-studded-top-with-ruffles-c719021p4590552.html</a></p>
<p>Enjoy the experience!</p>
