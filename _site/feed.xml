Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Tom'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

However, today I won’t be talking about Search. Today I would like to speak about a very cool initiative that Zara is testing on their website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Return rates are a big issue for ecommerce, especially in Retail. One of the reasons behind the high return rates is the lack of consistency in sizing from one brand to another. I love to see how companies are focusing on solving this and using very creative solutions to help us choose the best size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;From the solutions I have seen, one of my favourites is the one Zara is testing on their site. In some of the product pages you can find a link under Select Size that says “What’s my size?”, as shown on the image below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-5867 size-full&quot; src=&quot;/assets/zara1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;zara1&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When you click on it, it launches an overlay asking for your height, weight and how you want the product to fit, if tighter, perfect or looser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-5865 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;/assets/zara-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;zara 2&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;546&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Once you have added your measurements, fit preference and clicked on Find my size, it shows what size other people like you bought. For the information I added it said that 81% of people with the same measurements and fit preference bought size S, but it that was not what made me really like this feature. What did was the comment under the size, which gives me information about returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;“Size S was bought and not returned by 81% of shoppers with your approximate height, weight and fit preference.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-5864 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;/assets/zara-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;zara 3&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;553&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is a great initiative to help find the right size, which is many times a big barrier to shop online, as well as one of the main reason for returning a product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The link is not available in all products. I have found it mainly in Jackets and Tops. I am not sure it is in products as Dresses or Trousers. If you want to try it, you can go to the product I have used for the post &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zara.com/uk/en/woman/tops/view-all/pearl-studded-top-with-ruffles-c719021p4590552.html&quot;&gt;https://www.zara.com/uk/en/woman/tops/view-all/pearl-studded-top-with-ruffles-c719021p4590552.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the experience!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;This week our blog post focuses on collaboration and how this theme throughout our business has aided us in our evolution. It’s an important value for us here at &lt;strong&gt;EmpathyBroker&lt;/strong&gt; and has led to many of our successes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;All my greatest achievements in life have been due to a great team ethos and spirit of collaboration and helping each other so that we all achieve. This applies in all areas, including any sporting achievements, work recognition or matters of house &amp;amp; home such as recently going unbeaten in the local 7 aside league. As the saying goes ‘no man/woman is an island’. No martech is an island either.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Empathy – ‘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;the ability to understand and share the feelings of another&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;’. This concept is at the core of our business and helps us achieve fantastic results with our many diverse partners. Whether they be in the electronics industry, retail or fashion we understand that these industries all bring different challenges and that we must empathize with these to improve our platform. Without this spirit of collaboration, there is no way that we would have got to where we are today and there is still more room for growth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Collaboration allows us to assess one’s self and understand strengths &amp;amp; weaknesses, areas in which you can grow and develop. Not just with regards to the &lt;strong&gt;EB platform&lt;/strong&gt; but also in relation to the organization. Great things happen when we work together, we learn from each other and can affect change in a much more efficient yet positive way by listening to other people’s ideas. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The understanding that collaboration is King has enabled us to create a platform in which we understand the necessity of being able to work with businesses incumbent architecture and we continue to develop to make sure that we can work with a variety of different platforms so that the integrations are reliable and robust. This also gives us the opportunity to work at scale as we combine our resources with many of our partners and internally to work on projects that ultimately give our platform the edge in a crowded marketplace.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We pride ourselves in this value of collaboration and feel that the more we work together, with our partners, internally and the marketplace the further we will go. We continue to grow our partnerships and are open to discussions with digital agencies/platforms that are looking to amplify their &lt;strong&gt;search experience&lt;/strong&gt;. If you are one of those, please get in touch. ‘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Two heads are better than one’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;login&quot;=&gt;&quot;borjac&quot;, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;borja.carriquiri@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;display_name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Studio Lashes Donosti&quot;, &quot;first_name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Studio Lashes Donosti&quot;, &quot;last_name&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;}</name><email>borja.carriquiri@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html">This week our blog post focuses on collaboration and how this theme throughout our business has aided us in our evolution.

Let’s focus on&lt;strong&gt; Search Happiness&lt;/strong&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Imagine this, my friend Anna lands on your site. She is looking for a dress for a party but she is not sure what style she wants. She runs a generic query, e.g ‘Dresses’, and checks some products. Then runs another query, ‘Party dresses’ this time, checks some more products and leaves the site.&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-5717 size-medium alignright&quot; src=&quot;/assets/Search-Happiness-is-Conversion-more-important-than-Happiness--300x200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Search-Happiness--is-Conversion-more-important-than-Happiness-&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Anna did not buy anything, her visit conversion rate was 0%. She did not even add to cart. However, does this make it a failed search visit? Anna did not buy, but she found the inspiration she was looking for. She will definitely come back to the site and will be more likely to buy the next time. This is because &lt;strong&gt;she achieved Search happiness&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Happiness always depends on expectations. Expectations vary from one person to the next. Depending on what your goals are, you will achieve your expectations, or you won’t. The same thing happens with Search. However, in this case, we could divide goals into 2 groups:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those that want to BUY something that’s known&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those that want to DISCOVER something that’s unknown (like my friend Anna)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The user’s behaviour is different in these 2 cases. As their goals are different, what works for one might not work for the other. These are some examples of how these 2 groups would behave:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot; aligncenter&quot; width=&quot;604&quot;&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;313&quot;&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BUYING Goal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;291&quot;&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DISCOVERING Goal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot; width=&quot;313&quot;&gt;Uses singular rather than plural&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;291&quot;&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Uses plurals more&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;313&quot;&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Uses more words&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;291&quot;&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Uses less words&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot; width=&quot;313&quot;&gt;Uses words that match the language of the store (brands/styles)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;291&quot;&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Uses words that are distant from store language&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;313&quot;&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;If what is expected to be seen is not seen on 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; page will quickly send a second query, or filter using filters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;291&quot;&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Spends more time scrolling down and on results page, and less usage of filters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot; width=&quot;313&quot;&gt;Lower number of products viewed&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;291&quot;&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Higher number of products viewed, discovering different products&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;313&quot;&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Adds to Cart from Result page (if available)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;291&quot;&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Does NOT Add to Cart from result page&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
